CS 144 Final Project

## Overview
RoomieMatch is a web application that helps UCLA students find compatible roommates based on lifestyle and personality traits. Users will fill out a profile questionnaire (sleep schedule, cleanliness, study habits, social preferences, etc.), and our system will use a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to find and recommend the most similar profiles. Users can swipe or drag & drop profiles into "Like" and "Dislike" categories. Matches are stored and can be revisited later. It gives you their contact card (phone number, email, etc) if there is a match.
